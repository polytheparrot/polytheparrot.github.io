								<h2>A long and storied history of Spessmen Dev</h2>
								<p>Hey, I'm Incoming. As a SS13 dev I've coded for /tg/station, but there's a good chance you've found my work elsewhere because it's one of the bigger codebases. I tend to code a lot of things with a bit of whimsy to them, wizard stuff is a personal favorite. I also enjoy adding little bits of persistence to things like Poly here. The bird was the first, but certainly wasn't the last!<br /><br />
								Doing stuff for SS13 is a fun experience because it's laid out in such a way as to (usually) be fairly human readable. I started as an ideas guy who later took the time to sit down and learn the language, which is basically python but a little worse. My background is in Engineering so I have a little coding experience from that, but really it's the kind of thing you can accidentally learn to code over if you're passionate about the game. It was a passing fancy once but now I've been doing it for over half a decade!<br /><br />
								It's also a fun little way to have a little game dev wish fulfillment. Childhood dreams and all that. It's really cool to see hundreds of people experience your ideas (and occasionally then proceed to yell at you about it). Personally I'd love to make it more than just a hobby, but I'm not quite there yet. Even if I do get there spacemen almost certainly won't be what does it, but as long as I've the time and it's still fun I'll still be doing this stuff. Don't worry, I won't let Poly fall silent anytime soon!<br /><br />
								You can find a list of my contributions to the game <a href="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20author%3AIncoming5643%20">here</a>. If you're looking to support SS13 I strongly recommend finding out if the servers you enjoy are taking donations to cover costs. This is a game born of freely given time and money, and it can be quite a money pit if you run a fairly popular server alone.<br /><br />
								<a href="https://ko-fi.com/incomingnumbers">That said if you'd rather give money to this project specifically I'd certainly appreciate it, a tip on KoFi is the best way to help out.</a><br /><br />
								Beyond that if you want to help out just spread Poly far and wide. You don't know how much of a joy it is to me that there's a demand for this stuff.<br /><br /> 
								SS13 forever (remake never)!</p>
