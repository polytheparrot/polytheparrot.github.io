											<h2>What is Poly?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Poly the Parrot is an NPC from a game called <a href="https://spacestation13.com/">Space Station 13</a> (SS13). There are many different versions of this game but happily most of them include Poly in one form or another.<br /><br />
										The thing about SS13 is that it's completely round based. After every shift the slate is wiped utterly clean, erasing everything.<br /><br />
										Well, almost everything...</p>
										<ul class="actions">
											<li><a href="Poly.html" class="button">Enter Poly</a></li>
										</ul>

											<h2>What is this Twitter account?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/Poly_the_Parrot">@Poly_the_Parrot</a> twitter account is a feed of things Poly has overheard and memorized from the crew.<br /><br />
										By tapping into this phrasebook an endless wellspring of SS13 flavored text can be harvested, straight from the players mouths to your twitter feed!<br /><br />
										Keep in mind that SS13 is a very user driven game, and that most servers are +18. Poly therefore will almost surely pick up all sorts of less than family friendly statements.<br /><br /> 
										Players of the game will probably take this in stride, but for those of us with weaker hearts it might be a bit offensive. Just remember that Poly is indiscriminate; he knows not what he says.</p>

											<h2>Who is involved in this operation?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>This twitter account draws its phrases from the <a href="https://tgstation13.org/">/tg/station branch of SS13</a>. It is one of the most ubiquitous versions of the game and provides a good cross section of SS13 chatter.<br /><br />
										The <a href="https://twitter.com/Poly_the_Parrot">@Poly_the_Parrot</a> project itself is a pet project of one of the long time coders of this branch, <a href="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/22269">Incoming</a>. This is also the person who is writing this right now, me.<br /><br />
