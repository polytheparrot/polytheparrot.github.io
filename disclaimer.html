                                <p>Tweets from @Poly_the_Parrot are harvested automatically from Space Station 13. They are not selected for content. Tweets do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the creator of this account.<br /><br /> 
                                Space Station 13 is a game where players take on fictional roles and try to generate fictional conflict. <b>Absolutely nothing about what @Poly_the_Parrot tweets should be taken seriously.</b><br /><br />
                                Since this account is automated occasionally objectionable content may be posted. Know that this content is never designed to threaten, defame, libel, or otherwise provoke any individual or group of people. Subjects of @Poly_the_Parrot are fictional characters in a fictional universe, with any similarities to real people or places being purely coincidental.<br /><br />
                                @Poly_the_Parrot has no biases, no agenda, and no ability to discriminate. Content is never generated to purposefully promote or condemn any particular opinion or lifestyle.<br /><br />
                                If you have been offended by a tweet of @Poly_the_Parrot understand that parrots learning phrases that are in poor taste is indeed "part of the joke". If you feel that a tweet is offensive to the point of violating the twitter rules please email:<br /><br /><br />
                                <i>thebirdremembers (at) gmail.com</i><br /><br /><br />
                                and I will make a good faith effort to remove the content if I agree with the sentiment.
